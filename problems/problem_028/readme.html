<p>Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise
direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="red"><strong>21</strong></span> 22 23 24 <span
class="red"><strong>25</strong></span><br />
20  <span class="red"><strong>7</strong></span>  8  <span
class="red"><strong>9</strong></span> 10<br />
19  6  <span class="red"><strong>1</strong></span>  2 11<br />
18  <span class="red"><strong>5</strong></span>  4  <span
class="red"><strong>3</strong></span> 12<br />
<span class="red"><strong>17</strong></span> 16 15 14 <span
class="red"><strong>13</strong></span></p>
<p>It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is
101.</p>
<p>What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001
spiral formed in the same way?</p>
