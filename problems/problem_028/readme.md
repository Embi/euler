Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise
direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

<span class="red">**21**</span> 22 23 24
<span class="red">**25**</span>  
20  <span class="red">**7**</span>  8  <span class="red">**9**</span>
10  
19  6  <span class="red">**1**</span>  2 11  
18  <span class="red">**5**</span>  4  <span class="red">**3**</span>
12  
<span class="red">**17**</span> 16 15 14 <span class="red">**13**</span>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral
formed in the same way?
