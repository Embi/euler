<p>Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a
square spiral with side length 7 is formed.</p>
<p><span class="red"><strong>37</strong></span> 36 35 34 33 32 <span
class="red"><strong>31</strong></span><br />
38 <span class="red"><strong>17</strong></span> 16 15 14 <span
class="red"><strong>13</strong></span> 30<br />
39 18 <span class="red"> <strong>5</strong></span>  4 <span
class="red"> <strong>3</strong></span> 12 29<br />
40 19  6  1  2 11 28<br />
41 20 <span class="red"> <strong>7</strong></span>  8  9 10 27<br />
42 21 22 23 24 25 26<br />
<span class="red"><strong>43</strong></span> 44 45 46 47 48 49</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom
right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13
numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ≈
62%.</p>
<p>If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a
square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is
continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the
ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?</p>
