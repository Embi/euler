Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a
square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

<span class="red">**37**</span> 36 35 34 33 32
<span class="red">**31**</span>
38 <span class="red">**17**</span> 16 15 14
<span class="red">**13**</span> 30
39 18 <span class="red"> **5**</span>  4 <span class="red"> **3**</span>
12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20 <span class="red"> **7**</span>  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
<span class="red">**43**</span> 44 45 46 47 48 49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom
right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13
numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ≈
62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square
spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of
primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
