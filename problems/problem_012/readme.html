<p>The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural
numbers. So the 7<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:</p>
<p>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...</p>
<p>Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong> 1</strong>: 1<br />
<strong> 3</strong>: 1,3<br />
<strong> 6</strong>: 1,2,3,6<br />
<strong>10</strong>: 1,2,5,10<br />
<strong>15</strong>: 1,3,5,15<br />
<strong>21</strong>: 1,3,7,21<br />
<strong>28</strong>: 1,2,4,7,14,28
</blockquote>
<p>We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five
divisors.</p>
<p>What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five
hundred divisors?</p>
