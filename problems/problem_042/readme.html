<p>The <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> term of the sequence of triangle numbers
is given by, <em>t<sub>n</sub></em> = Â½<em>n</em>(<em>n</em>+1); so the
first ten triangle numbers are:</p>
<p>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...</p>
<p>By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 =
<em>t</em><sub>10</sub>. If the word value is a triangle number then we
shall call the word a triangle word.</p>
<p>Using <a href="p042_words.txt">words.txt</a> (right

two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?</p>
