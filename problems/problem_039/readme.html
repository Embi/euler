<p>If <em>p</em> is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with
integral length sides, {<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>,<em>c</em>}, there are
exactly three solutions for <em>p</em> = 120.</p>
<p>{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}</p>
<p>For which value of <em>p</em> â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions
maximised?</p>
